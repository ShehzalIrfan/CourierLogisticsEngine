A C++ based logistics simulation system implementing core Data Structures & Algorithms to intelligently sort parcels, compute optimal delivery routes, track parcel lifecycles, and manage courier operations.

Key Features: Priority-based parcel sorting
Shortest & alternative route computation
Dynamic parcel tracking with event history
Courier workflow simulation (queues, assignment, transit)
File-based persistence

Data Structures & Algorithms:
Heap / Priority Queue – Parcel prioritization
Graph + Dijkstra Algorithm – Route optimization
AVL Tree – Efficient parcel lookup
Linked List – Tracking history
Queue & Stack – Courier and warehouse operations

Tech Stack: Language: C++ Concepts: DSA, OOP, File Handling Tools: Git, GitHub
